## Router.isReady property

Returns a Promise that resolves when the router has completed the initial navigation, which means it has resolved all async enter hooks and async components that are associated with the initial route. If the initial navigation already happened, the promise resolves immediately.

This is useful in server-side rendering to ensure consistent output on both the server and the client. Note that on server side, you need to manually push the initial location while on client side, the router automatically picks it up from the URL.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
isReady: () => Promise<void>;
```
