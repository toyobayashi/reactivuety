## RouteRecordNormalized.instances property

Mounted route component instances Having the instances on the record mean beforeRouteUpdate and beforeRouteLeave guards can only be invoked with the latest mounted app instance if there are multiple application instances rendering the same view, basically duplicating the content on the page, which shouldn't happen in practice. It will work if multiple apps are rendering different named views.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
instances: Record<string, ComponentInternalInstance | undefined | null>;
```
