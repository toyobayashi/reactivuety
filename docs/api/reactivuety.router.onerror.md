## Router.onError property

Adds an error handler that is called every time a non caught error happens during navigation. This includes errors thrown synchronously and asynchronously, errors returned or passed to `next` in any navigation guard, and errors occurred when trying to resolve an async component that is required to render a route.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
onError: (handler: _ErrorHandler) => () => void;
```
